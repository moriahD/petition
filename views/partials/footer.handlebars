    <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><b>Is cigarette waste toxic?</b>
Yes! Littered cigarette butts leach toxic chemicals—such as arsenic (used to kill rats) and lead, to name a few—into the environment and can contaminate water. The toxic exposure can poison fish, as well as animals who eat cigarette butts.  <b>What is in a typical cigarette filter? </b> It may look like cotton, but 98 percent of cigarette filters are made of plastic fibers (cellulose acetate) that are tightly packed together, which leads to an estimated 1.69 billion pounds of cigarette butts winding up as toxic trash each year. <b>Are cigarettes biodegradable? </b> No—the plastic fibers in cigarettes are non-biodegradable, meaning they won't organically break down from living organisms.</marquee>
