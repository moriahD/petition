debugging

when you encounter a bug, that doesn't mean you are a bad developer or stupid - it just part of our lives...

1. Should I fix this bug right now? Is this priority?

    - Primary experiences : logging in / registering, signing the petition
    - Secondary experiences : number of signers on "thank you" page doesn't show
    - Every major website you visit has bugs.

2. read the error message

    - note where the error appeared.
        - Did it appear in the Dev Tools? Or in your Terminal?
        - If you don't see an error message, that likely means you're not "catching" your errors!

3. pinpoint where the bug is happening.

    - What was the expected behavior of this code? In other words... what did I think would happen?
    - What actually happened?

4. sometimes... you'll have to get a bit frustrated and bang your head against (not literally). That's ok, that's part of the learning process :)

5. try by yourself to fix the bug for at the very least 30 min.

6. Ask your peers for help.

    - obvious benefit is that your classmates might have the answer
    - rubber duck principle: discussing your bug out loud can help you find it. Sometimes you need a peer to describe your bug at, and this in and of itself can help you discover the bug

7. ask a teacher.
    - we should be your last resort.
    - have Atom open, have your server running.
    - spend a few minutes thinking about how to explain your bug... saying "it doesn't work" tells me nothing. However, "when I sign the petition and hit the submit button, the console log in my 'POST' /petition route in my server doesn't happen"
    - Demo the bug. Know how to replicate the bug.

TAKE BREAKS!!!!!!
